# Htriple

## Plan

- Construct a set of logics and forms that can represent statements and requirements
- Write some simple (proof of concept) solvers for them
- Use these solvers and representations to construct and find missing requirements in systems of Hoare triples
- Write a domain specific language that constructs these Hoare triples and building small programs out of them

## Layout

- app/ holds all the code for the executable that can be used for experimenting with the DSL
- test/ holds all the test specific code
- lib/ holds all the core code for defining the DSL, solvers and data structures
